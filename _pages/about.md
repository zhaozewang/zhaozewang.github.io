I am a PhD student at Penn Electrical and System Engineering. Before this, I completed my undergrad in Computer Engineering at Boston University and then earned a Master's in Computer and Information Science from Penn.

I'm interested in the question of why we can learn, and how biological brains, even the simplest ones, uncover patterns without any prior understanding of the task? 

My current research focuses on navigation. Specifically, how might the brain navigate without an inherent understanding of the space that guides its movement? What we’ve discovered is that by simply associating sensory signals during random movement, place cells emerge—patterns that reflect an intrinsic spatial understanding. This most elementary form of learning is already enough to capture the correlation of sensory inputs across time, giving rise to a constructed sense of space. In other words, time is the maketh of space and even of the mind. Animals fold their experiences across time in brain and thereby unfold the future.
