Glomerular podocyte foot process effacement is one of the characteristics indicator proteinuria diseases. Therefore, quantifying and measuring the foot processes (FP) width as well as GBM width/length could be indicative of potential kidney diseases. This is traditionally done by manually measuring GBM thickness in TEM with ImageJ, which is time-consuming and tedious. We developed an automated pipeline for this process to improve the efficiency of the measurement. Our automated measurements could distinguish healthy from pathological kidneys on littermate mice. <br>
